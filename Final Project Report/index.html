<p>An acquaintance of mine, Charlie who works in the gaming industry was able to give me feedback on my game. 
    The results I received were more than I expected, in which I was happy about. 
    The overall usability and the navigation of the game is not 100% clear to where you can guarantee every user to understand without thinking.
    First of the "start the game" is usuless after the first pressing "start" in the homescreen.
    The side bar with the letters are very small to see for the user to recognize and the pigs around the casino tables look very unprofessional.
    When I press the "restart" button, it should not direct me back to the the home page, rather the same page.

    <p>I also asked my older brother, who is a UX designer in the technology industry for his feedback. 
    The feedback I recieved were quite brutal but nonetheless, I have much more hope for this final project to turn out well.
    He mostly repeated what Charlie said earlier but added on to the fact of the homepage even existing. 
    He explained how this homepage prevented him from being consfused throughout the rest of the game because the instructions were not clear.
    He suggested that it would be better to stick to one page and potentionally having the "Instructions" button in the gaming page.
    He also suggested how the placement of the buttons could better in terms of size and how recognizable the buttons are.
