<p>The pictures above shows the step by step process of the newly updated visual for my pig card game.
    This approach is to have a newly designed game where it focuses on the UX design for the game. 
    Specifically, I focused on navigation throughout the game, and making buttons and the direction of the game rather more obvious to not make the user think.
    I wanted it to make a seamless experience where users could play and have fun.
