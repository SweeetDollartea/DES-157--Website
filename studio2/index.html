            <h1>Climbing Mount Fuji!</h1>
            <p>These are the photos I took, when I climbed Mount Fuji in July of 2021 with my family.
                I will take you through my journey of the different sceneries that I photographed.

            <h1>First Climb</h1>
            <p>There are a total of 10 stations in Mount Fuji.
                Typically, most climbers take the bus from the 1st to the 5th and start climbing from there.
                This first photo was taken on the way to the 6th station. 
                The angle of the mountain and the mass surface area made it quite easy to walk through the dirt.
                Climbing to the 6th station was a piece of cake.

            <h1>Still Climbing</h1>
            <p>This photo was taken around half-way through the climb, approximately the 8th station.
                It is apparent that the surrounding atmosphere has changed and transitioned to walking at an higher incline, while avoiding rocks on the way.
                Our stamina was slowly starting to deteriorate, as we often took breaks because the climb started to become rather dangerous.

            <h1>Summit! Almost</h1>
            <p>After spending a night in 9th station. 
                We woke up early morning before sunset to climb to the final 10th station.
                Due to the altitude and the angle of the mountain, it made this the toughest climb in our journey yet.
                This took nearly two hours, as my mom was having difficulty climbing with her injured knees.
                However, my parents were able to enter the torii gate that is placed in the summit of the mountain.

            <h1>To the Top!</h1>
            <p>
                After I reached the summit, I was informed that I can walk another 2-3 hundred meters to the absolute highest peak of the mountain.
                We climbed Mount Fuji during Covid-19, which meant that there were a lack of climbers in general. 
                I was told that it will take around an extra hour to climb including foot traffic, but since there weren't any, I was suggested to climb, if I had any energy left.
                The rest of my family quit climbing after reaching the "summit", but I persevered to climb the rest, fulfilling one my bucketlist to climb Mount Fuji.
                This fourth photo was taken when I reached that point.
