<title>Project Brief: Pig Card Game</title>
<p>I decided to choose the Game On! project to update for my final project because I spent the most time creating this game and want to perfect it.
    To upgrade the site, I would want to focus on the UX of the design to upgrade the usability and help navigate the user through the entirety of the game. 
    I want my game to navigate seamlessly through for the user and feel as if a professional made this. 
    To make it more legit, I would need to have buttons where they are more visible, upgraded background image, change the functionality and not make the user have to think. 
    To get further feedback, I will ask my brother, who is a product designer and my friend, who is a computer science major.
    I believe that I could gain insightful feedback from two people who have experience in working with UX designers and test to see if my game is up to par.
