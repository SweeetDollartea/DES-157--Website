                <li><h3>Overlay Design Patterns</h3><p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">This article</a> published by the Nielsen Norman Group discusses the significance of using overlays for the right purpose. 
                    Oftentimes, many people will either misuse or overuse this in their web designs. As a result, many users get frustrated and alter the way in which the users are being distracted and slow down their progress. 
                    With that being said, I enjoyed how the author, Kathryn Whitenton, explains the 5 questions of who, what, where, when and why to help guide the programmers to use overlays in their websites. 
                    The most effective way to use overlays is to implement them without disrupting the user experience from the content that they want to see. Successful overlays are implemented effectively and enhance the way in which the user navigates. 
                    All in all, the main point of overlays is to inform the user with relevant information without necessarily distracting them from what they want to do on the website. 
                    The five W’s helps with critically analyzing the user’s priority and the necessary info for the users. It should be seen as a convenience for users’ rather than users clicking off the overlay to dismiss it. 
                    This approach to such use for overlays can make the users feel informed and satisfied with the experience.

                <li><h3>Forms</h3><p>Oftentimes when we come across a website, whether it is to apply to jobs or shopping online, we come across forms that allow the customer to enter their personal information for a benefit of their own. 
                When designing a form, it is crucial to understand the in and outs of why and how users will interact with and feel the need to fill in the form. 
                What differentiates a good form and a bad form is how the questions are asked, layed out and what the user will see on their end of the website. 
                For example, having a clear picture of how many steps that is necessary to complete the form will often lead to a higher chance of users completing the form. 
                Even with such small changes, the credibility of the website can increase and diminish privacy concerns. <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">This article</a> explains the signifcance of good forms designs thoroughly.</p></li>

            <ul>
            <li><p><a href="https://www.av0lve.xyz/?ref=lapaninja">This NFT website</a> is an example where I find an interesting form where it allows the user to engage by adding their wallet address first and transitioning to another page.
            This is a good practice of where the user only has to focus a thing at once and not asking for multiple informations on the first page.</p></li>
