                <li><p>Oftentimes when we come across a website, whether it is to apply to jobs or shopping online, we come across forms that allow the customer to enter their personal information for a benefit of their own. 
                When designing a form, it is crucial to understand the in and outs of why and how users will interact with and feel the need to fill in the form. 
                What differentiates a good form and a bad form is how the questions are asked, layed out and what the user will see on their end of the website. 
                For example, having a clear picture of how many steps that is necessary to complete the form will often lead to a higher chance of users completing the form. 
                Even with such small changes, the credibility of the website can increase and diminish privacy concerns. <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">This article</a> explains the signifcance of good forms designs thoroughly.</p></li>

            <li><p><a href="https://www.av0lve.xyz/?ref=lapaninja">This NFT website</a> is an example where I find an interesting form where it allows the user to engage by adding their wallet address first and transitioning to another page.
            This is a good practice of where the user only has to focus a thing at once and not asking for multiple informations on the first page.</p></li>
